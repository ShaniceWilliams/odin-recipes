            <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>

        <ol>

            </div>   
            <li>Add the butter to the flour mixture and smash it with a fork to combine. Continue to combine the butter and flour mixture until it has a sandy, crumb-like texture.</li>

            <li>Add the water, a little at a time, to the flour and butter mixture and stir it with a fork or your hand to form a dough. Knead for about 2-4 minutes. There should still be some flour that needs to be worked into the dough.</li>
            <img src="../images/dumplings/wetmix.jpg" alt="" height="500">
            <li>Transfer the contents of the bowl to a clean, dry work surface and knead the dough until all dry ingredients are just combined. Do not over-knead the dough. It should still look a little rough on the outside and not smooth. Cover the dough with a wet paper towel and allow to rest for at least 10 minutes, ideally 30 minutes.</li>
            <img src="../images/dumplings/dough.jpg" alt="" height="500">
            <li>Tear off golf ball sized amounts of dough and roll slightly into a ball. When all dough balls are rolled, gently flatten them in the centre only slightly before carefully placing them in the oil a few at a time. This helps them to fry evenly (they will form back into round balls in the oil). Cover your dough again while your oil heats up.

            <li>Tear off a small piece of dough no larger than a 1/2 teaspoon and place it in the oil. If the oil around the dough starts to bubble all around it then it’s ready for frying.</li>
            <img src="" alt="" height="500">
            <li>Cook the dough in the oil until golden brown on each side, flipping when needed (approximately 6 - 8 minutes).</li>

            <li>Place a few paper towels onto a plate. Carefully remove the dumplings from the oil and transfer them to the plate. Serve warm.</li>
